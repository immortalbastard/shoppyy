# Shopping List
Shopping List is a class project from Mobile Software Development (taught by Mr.Wanyama at Emobilis). It is an Android application that stores items users add to their shopping list in a database and allows them to edit and remove items.

## Features
This application gives the user a simple way to create and update their shopping list on their device. Items can be added to the list using the floating + button, and users can enter information about the item they need to buy, including name, category, estimated price, and any other details they would like to enter. These items appear on the main shopping list page with any information entered by the user and an icon reflecting the category they selected. Items can be edited by clicking on the item in the list and using the Edit Item dialog, or deleted individually at any point. The user can also check off items they have bought and clear all the checked items, or they can delete all items from their list.

The application starts with a customized animation on a splash screen, which leads straight into the main list Activity. The application uses RecyclerView to efficiently store items in the list view, and it is backed by a Room database which updates automatically when the user changes any information.
